# Function
Declare a function called `is_even` that returns a `bool`. The parameter list will consist of an
integer. It will return true if the integer passed to the function is even, and false otherwise.
The `main()` function shall ask the user for a number, pass the number to the function `is_even()`, and
print one of the following sentences based on the output of the function: "You entered an even
number!" or "You entered an odd number!"

## Hints
- Think about makes a number even or odd, and how we can do that in our code.

## Remember
- Name your file wsuid\_lab04.cpp
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
